# Persistence context

The Persistence context maps PostgreSQL records to the Application and Domain contexts. PostgreSQL is the system of record; the Drizzle schema and a single squashed initial migration are versioned together.

Tenant and project boundaries are enforced by composite foreign keys as well as Repository query predicates. Task effort is stored as integer person-minutes, progress as integer basis points (0–10000), the daily planned-value plot as a sparse jsonb `ISO-date → minutes` map, work and status dates as PostgreSQL `date`, and audit timestamps as `timestamptz` strings. Money is not in the core; it re-enters in Phase 2 as a derived `rate × effort` layer.

The worksheet is a single self-referential `tasks` table: each row carries the 23 typed worksheet columns natively (process, product, review/change references, note, contract, planned effort L, progress T, actual effort W, actual start/finish, and the daily plot), a `parent_task_id` self-foreign-key for the D→F hierarchy, and a nullable `assignee_member_id`. `task_dependencies` holds typed FS/SS/FF/SF edges keyed on tasks; `members` is the simple assignee/capacity table keyed to a `project_calendars` calendar. Composite foreign keys keep every link inside its project.

OIDC principals are keyed by issuer/subject independently of any tenant. Tenant memberships and explicit project memberships bind a human or agent principal to authorization roles. Agent scopes are an allowlist stored with the principal; effective permission is the intersection of the stored allowlist and signed token scopes. Disabled or cross-tenant principals do not resolve to an access grant.

PostgresProjectCommandUnitOfWork locks the tenant-scoped Project row and commits the validated Current mutation, revision, AuditEvent, and command receipt atomically. It reconstitutes Current from tasks, task dependencies, members, and calendars, then reconciles native task columns and re-inserts dependency edges. Audit events and command receipts are append-only, enforced by database triggers. Command receipts are keyed by tenant/project/idempotency key; a canonical SHA-256 request hash prevents the same key from representing different commands. Concurrent retries serialize on the Project lock and replay one result. Migrations run from release tooling over a direct PostgreSQL connection, never during a Worker request or through Hyperdrive.

Plan branches, plan freezing, the numeric optimizer, and the probabilistic simulator are deferred to Phase 2/3 and are not part of this schema.

## Language

- **Task**: one worksheet row — a summary parent or a leaf subtask — carrying the 23 typed columns and its daily planned-value plot.
- **Member**: a project-scoped assignee with a working calendar and daily capacity; a task references at most one member.
- **Task dependency**: a typed FS/SS/FF/SF edge with non-negative working-day lag between two tasks.
- **Command receipt**: an append-only tenant/project/idempotency-key record binding a canonical request hash to the resulting revision.
