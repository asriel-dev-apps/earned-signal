# HANDOFF — VECTA (updated 2026-07-22)

Session-recovery state — **kept lean on purpose**. Only what's needed to CONTINUE lives here;
completed history is in `docs/agents/HANDOFF-archive.md` (full backup, not loaded each session).
Keep it this way: when you finish something, move its detail to the archive, not here.

Advisor = the Claude Code **Advisor feature** (`/advisor fable` pairs this Opus main with a Fable
advisor). Implementation is delegated to opus/general-purpose subagents; the main session designs,
independently verifies (`pnpm check` + scope/leak grep + screenshots), commits, pushes, deploys.

## Where things are

- Repo: `~/ghq/github.com/asriel-dev-apps/vecta`, remote `git@github.com:asriel-dev-apps/vecta.git`,
  branch **`adr-0011-effort-wbs-realignment`** (all work here; not yet merged to `main`).
- Governing docs (read as needed):
  - `docs/adr/0011-effort-based-wbs-evm-realignment.md` — the realignment decision.
  - `docs/design/0002-step2-effort-wbs-grid.md` — data model (**§12 advisor decisions authoritative**).
  - `docs/design/0003-wbs-ui-realignment-backlog.md` — the P0–P3 feature backlog (P0–P2 done).
  - `docs/design/0004-performance-realtime-architecture.md` — **perf/real-time direction (DRAFT,
    not approved)**; principles + Phase 0/1 plan; work through with the user before building Phase 1.
- Private master requirements are outside the repo in `../.wbs-private/` — **never read it**.

## Current live state

- **design 0003 FULLY COMPLETE and DEPLOYED** (P0–P3), plus the header + login redesigns and the
  theme toggle. Live: **https://vecta.tt-dev.workers.dev** (worker `vecta`, worker version
  **`13c29cb5`** = latest G-1 deploy). Auth = Google OIDC; persistence = Neon serverless
  (`DATABASE_URL` secret). After a deploy, allow **~30 s propagation** before the served
  `index-*.js` hash matches the build (verify the hash, not just the version id).
- **DB schema at migration 0005** (Neon, prod): `tasks` model + `members` + project-scoped masters
  `processes`/`products` + `subtask_templates`; review/change refs and `daily_plan_locked` dropped.
- **Prod project holds 48 synthetic test tasks** (8 phases × 5 subtasks) + 8 processes / 6 products /
  6 members / 2 default templates / 32 deps (all generic "Phase A"/"Product 1"/"Member 01"); admin
  membership intact (revision 11). Replaced the earlier junk stubs.
- Full gate green on the branch (domain 32, application 67, persistence 34, web 112); CI (`ci.yml`,
  checks-only) runs on every branch push + PRs and is green on Actions.

## Active work / backlog

- **Login screen redesign** — DONE + deployed (`5ea0775`, worker `d536542b`): asymmetric layout,
  VECTA-origin tagline ("Earned Value, Cost & Timeline Analytics" + the *vector* origin), enriched
  WBS/EVM hero (schedule bars + dependency links + milestones + earned-value S-curve → vector arrow),
  and an **app-wide theme toggle** (System/Light/Dark via `data-theme` on `<html>`, instant live
  switching; the pure `prefers-color-scheme` didn't switch live). Toggle in the app bar + on login.
- **P3 — F-1 DONE + deployed** (`26d51df`, worker `826cbd89`): project-scoped **immutable display
  No.** — `tasks.seq` + `projects.next_task_seq`, No. shows `0001`-style. **Migration 0006 applied to
  live Neon** (verified: 48 tasks → seq 1..48, all unique, `next_task_seq`=49); 7 migrations applied.
  Assigned at creation, never renumbered (gaps ok, structural via seq excluded from updates),
  tasks+subtasks share the counter.
- **P3 — G-1 DONE + deployed** (`da764ea`, worker `13c29cb5`): member daily-total bottom panel —
  rows=members, columns=the grid's own dayVirtualizer (pixel-aligned), per-day Σ dailyPlan +
  ExternalLoad shown in hours, capacity-overflow red (reuses `detectOverloads`/`overloadByKey`),
  horizontal-scroll mirrored with the grid, quiet "メンバー日次負荷" toggle (closed by default).
- **design 0003 is fully implemented + live.** The current major work is the architecture migration in
  **ADR `docs/adr/0012-react-router-cloudflare-ssr-architecture.md`** (agreed 2026-07-22): migrate the SPA
  to **React Router v8 (framework mode) SSR on Cloudflare**. Staged migration — a NEW parallel app is built
  at **`apps/web-next`** while the live `apps/web` stays untouched; at cutover `apps/web` is deleted and
  `web-next` renamed → `web`. Implement from the ADR's **"Implementation order"** (6 steps; self-contained).
- **ADR 0012 Step 1 — DONE** (`5acea4f`): `apps/web-next` scaffold = RR **v8.2.0** framework mode
  (`ssr:true`) on Cloudflare Workers. `workers/app.ts` dispatches `/api` + `/mcp` → **Hono** (skeleton:
  `/api/health` ok, `/mcp` 501 placeholder), else → the RR request handler. Home route `loader` runs
  server-side and reuses `@vecta/domain`'s EVM calc over a synthetic fixture → value is in first-paint HTML
  (SSR proven, `data-ssr-spi="0.75"`). Reuses the pure-TS packages (workspace deps) + unchanged Neon schema.
  Versions pinned to the monorepo; `wrangler` name `vecta-next-local`. **Root `pnpm check` green** with
  web-next included (web-next test 1); `apps/web` byte-for-byte unchanged. Not deployed.
  - **Known local-dev limitation**: this machine's bundled workerd/miniflare caps `compatibility_date` at
    `2026-07-15`, but `web-next/wrangler.jsonc` uses `2026-07-17` (same as `apps/web`). So `react-router
    dev`/miniflare won't boot locally without a **temporary** date toggle to `2026-07-15` (revert after).
    Build / typecheck / test / `pnpm check` are unaffected (they don't invoke workerd).
- **ADR 0012 Step 2 — DONE** (`e5aaeb1`): server-side **OIDC authorization-code flow → httpOnly signed
  cookie session** in `apps/web-next` (amends 0002). `__Host-` session cookie (httpOnly/Secure/SameSite=Lax,
  `SESSION_SECRET`(+`_PREVIOUS`) signed), payload `{principalId, exp}` with **`exp` enforced server-side**
  (RR doesn't enforce cookie maxAge server-side), 7-day absolute. Flow: `/login` (PKCE S256 + state + nonce,
  validated `returnTo`, `__Secure-oidc_tx` transient cookie) → provider → `/auth/callback` (error-branch first,
  state check, code exchange, jose **RS256** verify iss/aud=client_id/exp/nonce, **`(issuer,subject)` →
  principal, no JIT**) → session; `/logout`. Config env-driven (`OIDC_*` `.invalid` placeholder vars; secrets
  `OIDC_CLIENT_SECRET`/`SESSION_SECRET` via `.dev.vars`/Worker secrets, **audience = client_id**, no discovery
  fetch). RR v8 load context via **`RouterContextProvider`** (typed `appContext`/`principalContext`) wired in
  `workers/app.ts`; `/api`+`/mcp` dispatched to Hono **before** RR (never cookie-auth), exact-prefix matched.
  **Fail-closed**: a protected pathless-layout middleware requires auth; `/login`,`/auth/callback`,`/logout`
  public. Principal+memberships resolved **once per request** (memoized promise → one DB hit under single-fetch
  parallel loaders). `oidc_tx` cleared on **every** callback outcome incl. backend failure (503, not 500);
  root `ErrorBoundary` backstop; error screens carry status (403/400/503). **50 web-next unit tests** (no
  net/DB). Fable security review: **no open P0**. Root `pnpm check` green; `apps/web` untouched. Not deployed.
- **ADR 0012 Step 3 — DONE** (`4bf70da`): multi-project router under the protected layout. `/` → redirect
  `/projects`; `/projects` = principal's accessible-project list; `/projects/:id` = layout whose
  **middleware** is the fail-closed access gate + children `{index→wbs, wbs, dashboard, members, templates}`
  (Step-4 stubs). Gate: UUID-validate `params.id` → `await` the Step-2 memoized principal → **in-memory**
  `findProjectMembership` (NOT the resolver) → deny/unknown/malformed-or-uppercase-UUID = **`throw
  data(null,{status:404})` BEFORE `next()`** (indistinguishable, no existence oracle; no DB on deny). VIEWER
  passes (read); write-authz is Step 4. Context `{project, membership:{tenantId, projectId, projectRole,
  tenantRole}}` via a per-request **memoized thunk** (one project-row fetch by `(tenantId,id)` under parallel
  loaders); `requireProjectAccess(context)` helper. Each child route has a loader awaiting it → forces the
  `.data` round trip so the gate re-runs on client nav. Project-list = **`PostgresProjectListReader.
  listForPrincipal` in `@vecta/persistence`** (one `project_memberships⨝projects` query; Step-5 Hono reuses
  it). Deleted the Step-1 SSR demo home route. **59 web-next tests** (headline: on deny child loaders never
  run; IDOR/tenant + memoization + malformed/uppercase-id pinned) + persistence testcontainers test. Fable
  security review: **no open P0**; fixes applied (canonical-lowercase-only UUID guard, identical-404 payload
  assert, `close().catch` so close errors don't mask query errors). Root `pnpm check` green. Not deployed.
- **NEXT — ADR 0012 Step 4**: port the **WBS grid** + master/template/member screens into `/projects/:id/*`.
  Full fable-reviewed execution plan (decomposition + load-bearing invariants) is in
  **`docs/agents/adr-0012-step4-plan.md`** — implement from it (delete that doc when Step 4 is done). TL;DR:
  loader **SSRs the state view** (no flash), grid **client-hydrates** (virtualizer `initialRect` is the crux —
  spike first); `action` applies a one-POST command batch with **`expectedRevision`**, client keeps its
  optimistic + client-derived state with **no post-save re-settle** (`useState` survives revalidation;
  `shouldRevalidate` scoped on all active routes); conflict → action returns `data(409,…)` → adopt fresh
  loader data (no remount). Reads projected via `projectionRoleForProjectRole`+`projectWorkspaceView`; writes
  authorized via `createProjectCommandAuthorizer`. **Port `apps/web/src/App.tsx` wholesale, swap 2 data-plane
  seams** (no pure-view extraction). Sub-slices: **4-pre** per-request memoized DB session → **4a** read-only
  SSR grid (proving slice) → **4b** write path → **4c** master/template/member → **4d** queue + revalidate.
  **Spec-parity**: mirror the real spreadsheet; add nothing not in `apps/web`. The single most important test:
  client-optimistic transition === the unit-of-work transition for every command (see plan §0).
- **Then**: Step 5 mount Hono `/api/*` (zod-openapi) + `/mcp` over the command core (token-auth, never the
  cookie); Step 6 verify → careful cutover deploy (`apps/web` deleted, `web-next`→`web`) → then vision
  features (Gantt, dashboard, budget, CSV, member admin, LLM-via-commands). Real-time = Phase 1 (Cloudflare
  DO + WebSocket, free) later.
- **ADR 0012 cutover gates / debt** (before treating the migration done):
  - **Prod principal identity (R1, P1-2)**: the old app resolved access via a `subject="email:<addr>"`
    fallback (admin-seed path); web-next matches **exact `(issuer,subject)`** only. If the prod admin
    `principals` row still carries an `email:` subject, the first web-next login → forbidden / empty list.
    **Verify prod `principals.subject` values carry the real provider `sub` before cutover** (or do a
    one-time deliberate migration). Do NOT add the email fallback to the session login.
  - **web-next Neon-reader debt**: web-next has a direct `drizzle-orm` dep + two thin Neon read-seams that
    import persistence schema/conn: `app/server/auth/principal-directory.neon.server.ts` and
    `app/server/project/project-reader.neon.server.ts`. **Consider consolidating before/during Step 4**:
    move both Drizzle impls into `@vecta/persistence` (beside `project-access.ts`/`project-list.ts`), keep the
    `PrincipalDirectory`/`ProjectReader` interfaces in web-next, drop the direct `drizzle-orm` dep. The
    project-list read already lives in persistence (the right precedent). Interim: keep both `drizzle-orm`
    pins (0.45.2) in lockstep.
  - **Local dev**: real login needs `.dev.vars` (OIDC client secret + `SESSION_SECRET`) + the workerd
    compat-date toggle noted under Step 1.
- `docs/design/0004-performance-realtime-architecture.md` is **superseded by ADR 0012** (its Phase-0/1
  framing is resolved there).
- **Merge-to-main workflow**: user proposed branch → push → merge to main → deploy-on-main; not yet
  adopted (deploy is still manual). `deploy.yml` is manual-only + main-only + non-functional (needs
  GH secrets/vars).

## Manual deploy recipe (deploy is manual until CI is wired)

1. Temporarily overwrite `apps/web/wrangler.jsonc` with a FLAT config: `name:"vecta"`, `main`,
   `assets`(ASSETS), OIDC `vars` = Google standard (issuer `https://accounts.google.com`, audience =
   the Google client id, jwks `https://www.googleapis.com/oauth2/v3/certs`), three `ratelimits`
   (1001/1002/1003), **NO `hyperdrive` binding**, no `env` blocks.
2. Build with auth: `VITE_GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID=<id> VITE_VECTA_TENANT_ID=<t> VITE_VECTA_PROJECT_ID=<p>
   pnpm --dir apps/web build` (values in private memory `earned-signal-realignment.md`). Do **NOT**
   pass `--mode production` (the cloudflare plugin would suffix the worker to `vecta-production`).
3. **Deploy from the plugin-generated config, not the flat one** —
   `pnpm --dir apps/web exec wrangler deploy -c dist/vecta/wrangler.json --name vecta`. The flat
   `apps/web/wrangler.jsonc` has `assets` with **no `directory`** → it uploads the worker but serves
   **STALE assets** (success + new version, old bundle live). `dist/vecta/wrangler.json` carries
   `assets.directory: "../client"` (fresh) and just needs `--name vecta` to override its
   `vecta-production` name. **Verify after**: `ax https://vecta.tt-dev.workers.dev/` and confirm the
   served `assets/index-*.js` hash equals `apps/web/dist/client/index.html`'s (version id alone is
   NOT enough).
4. Migrate (only when there's a new migration): `DEPLOY_ENV=production DATABASE_URL=<keychain>
   EXPECTED_DATABASE_HOST=<url host> EXPECTED_DATABASE_NAME=<url dbname>
   pnpm --dir packages/persistence db:migrate` (script `packages/persistence/scripts/migrate.mjs`).
5. Restore `apps/web/wrangler.jsonc` (never commit the flat override) — `git stash push -- <file> &&
   git stash drop` (plain `git restore`/`checkout` are blocked by a hook → use stash or git-haiku).
6. Secret (persists; only to set/refresh): `printf '%s' "$(security find-generic-password -w -s
   vecta-database-url)" | wrangler secret put DATABASE_URL --name vecta`.

Screenshot pipeline (session-local, recreate as needed): a React-only vite build with the cloudflare
plugin dropped + `define` `import.meta.env.VITE_VECTA_PREVIEW` = "1"; the config must live **inside
`apps/web/`** (so `@vitejs/plugin-react` resolves) and its `build.outDir` must be **outside the repo**
(the repo `scratchpad/` is in `eslint .` scope); serve the outDir, shoot with `uv run --with
playwright python`. (For the login screen: define `VITE_GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID`, leave `VITE_VECTA_PREVIEW`
unset → the LoginScreen renders.)

## Process rules (hard-won; do not relax)

- **Spec parity**: the user's real spreadsheet is the only spec for the WBS grid. Never add
  columns/UI/features not requested (past formal rebuke). Requested UI changes (header, login, etc.)
  are fine. Internal state stays internal (flags, not UI).
- Flow per change: implement (subagent) → independently verify (`pnpm check` at root + scope + leak
  grep + screenshots) → commit → **leak audit** (case-insensitive: machine username / home paths /
  emails / connection strings / keys / NUL bytes, incl. untracked) → push (git-haiku) → deploy when
  user-visible + verify the served bundle hash.
- Never read `.wbs-private/`. All fixtures/demo/seed data synthetic + generic. No real
  names/paths/values in code, tests, docs, commits.
- Secrets: never in chat/repo. `DATABASE_URL` is macOS Keychain **`vecta-database-url`** (read with
  `security find-generic-password -w -s vecta-database-url`; pipe straight into env / `wrangler
  secret put` — never print). Deploy identifiers (client id, tenant/project UUIDs, admin identity)
  are in private memory `earned-signal-realignment.md`, not the repo.
- A Neon password rotation is pending on the user side; after it, update the Keychain item + re-run
  `wrangler secret put DATABASE_URL --name vecta`.
